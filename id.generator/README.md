### Components Of Id
- **Sequence Id**: Sequence number is 12 bits, which give us 2 ^ 12 = 4096 combinations. This field is 0 unless
  more than one ID is generated in a millisecond on the same server. In theory, a machine can
  support a maximum of 4096 new IDs per millisecond.

- Datacenter IDs and machine IDs are chosen at the startup time, generally fixed once the
  system is up running. Any changes in datacenter IDs and machine IDs require careful review
  since an accidental change in those values can lead to ID conflicts. Timestamp and sequence
  numbers are generated when the ID generator is running. 

- In current Implmentation we are picking system mac address to fill 10 bits

- **Timestamp**: The most important 41 bits make up the timestamp section. As timestamps grow with time,
  IDs are sortable by time.
  The maximum timestamp that can be represented in 41 bits is
  2 ^ 41 - 1 = 2199023255551 milliseconds (ms), which gives us: ~ 69 years. This means the ID
  generator will work for 69 years and having a custom epoch time close to todayâ€™s date delays
  the overflow time. After 69 years, we will need a new epoch time or adopt other techniques
  to migrate IDs.
